    <br>
    <p class="internal">Microbiology researcher taking on software development and finding new facets of problem solving and design to bring familiar skills to a new field. As I moved into development to advance myself in the microbiology field, I found a new passion that surprised me as I found out how similar my research had been to the development process.</p>

    <h2 class="internal">Programming</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="internal"> I started programming after talking to friends in graduate programs who were learning basic programming to process the findings in their thesis experiments. It seemed like a good way to make myself a valuable asset to a lab. It's hard to find anyone with lab experience willing to spend more time on a computer than getting hands on with the work and learning to code almost guarantees you'll find yourself needed at a desk. The more I worked in a lab, the more I realized, I wouldn't mind moving away from the lab bench. Once I had some Python down, I was hooked. That's when I enrolled in Nashville Software School and decided to make a career of it.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="internal"> I spent time travelling across the Southeast assessing land and conducting soil samples on ecologically diverse tracts. These samples were processed by Lodo Thearapeutics in New York where the DNA was extracted from microbes and examined. Patterns matching penicillin and other biological antibiotics were run against the raw DNA and a new antibiotic was found.</p>

        <h2 class="internal">Climbing</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="internal">My love of climbing is just another way to enjoy problem solving. The mental process of finding how to move your body across the rock and use every resource the edges and indentions in the rock provide to move up as effeciently as possible is an all encompassing challenge.</p>
