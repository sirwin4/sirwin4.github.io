    <h2 class="internal"> About Me</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="internal">Microbiology researcher taking on software development and finding new facets of problem solving and design to bring familiar skills to a new field. As I moved into development to advance myself in the microbiology field, I found a new passion that surprised me as I found out how similar my research had been to the development process.</p>

    <h2 class="internal">Microbiology</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="internal"> I spent time travelling across the Southeast assessing land and conducting soil samples on ecologically diverse tracts. These samples were processed by Lodo Thearapeutics in New York where the DNA was extracted from microbes and examined. Patterns matching penicillin and other biological antibiotics were run against the raw DNA and a new antibiotic was found.</p>

        <h2 class="internal">Climbing</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="internal">My love of climbing is just another way to enjoy problem solving. The mental process of finding how to move your body across the rock and use every resource the edges and indentions in the rock provide to move up as effeciently as possible is an all encompassing challenge.</p>
